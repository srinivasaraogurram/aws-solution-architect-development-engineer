## Overall Summary

I am a **Senior Cloud Solution Architect** with 10+ years of cloud experience (9+ on AWS) and 18+ years overall in IT. I specialize in **cloud migrations, serverless architectures, microservices decomposition, and enterprise modernization** across industries including media, education, telecom, healthcare, retail/food, and aviation.

I am fluent in **AWS Serverless (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS/SNS, EventBridge), Containers (ECS, EKS, Fargate), Data & Analytics (Glue, Athena, Redshift, Kinesis), and AI/LLM integration (Bedrock, Claude, Amazon Q)**.

I deliver **end-to-end modernization**:

* Lift-and-shift migrations re-engineered to cloud-native solutions.
* Event-driven architectures replacing monoliths and ESBs.
* IaC with Terraform, SAM, and Serverless Framework.
* Security aligned to HIPAA, PCI, FERPA, and SOC2 standards.
